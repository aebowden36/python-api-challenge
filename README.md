Latitude vs. Temperature:
It does appear that there is a curvilinear relationship between latitude and temperature. The closer that an individual gets to the equater, the higher the temperature can be expected to be.

Latitude vs. Humidity:
There does not appear to be a relationship between humidity and latitude. The points are scattered randomly and do not seem to have any sort of patterning.

Latitude vs. Cloudiness:
Again, there does not appear to be a relationship between cloudiness and latitude. There is even more spread between these data points and no obvious patterning.

Latitude vs. Wind Speed:
There is no obvious relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, there does appear to be a few outlier that could be skewing the data.

Hemisphere Temperature:
From these graphs, we can see that the northern and southern hemispheres have opposite realtionships with temperature. The northern hemisphere has a negative relationship, so as latitude increases, temperature decreases. The southern hemisphere has a positive relationship, so as latitude increases, as does temperature. The northern hemisphere also appears to have a stronger relationship with temperature than the southern hemisphere, however this could be due to differences in sample sizes.

Hemisphere Humidity:
There does not appear to be a difference between the southern and northern hemispheres in relation to humidity. Location does not seem to have an influence on humidity as there was no overall relationship and no difference between the northern and southern hemishpere.

Hemisphere Cloudiness:
Neither the northern or southern hemispheres appear to have a significant relationship with cloudiness. Location does not seem to have an influence on cloudiness as there was no overall relationship and no difference between the northern and southern hemishpere.

Hemisphere Wind Speed:
Neither the northern or southern hemispheres appear to have a significant relationship with wind speed. But, the relationship between wind speed and latitude does appear to be stronger in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere. This indicates that longitude could have a weak relationship with wind speed.
